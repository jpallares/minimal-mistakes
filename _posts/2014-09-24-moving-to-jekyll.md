After some time using a very simple google site as landing page and a blogger blog I decided to move everything 
to [Github pages](https://pages.github.com) + [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages).

In my humble opinion under this platform everything looks way more professional. 
To achieve this look a I used [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](http://mademistakes.com/articles/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/).
It comes with very cool fetures such as:

* Minimal design.
* Responsive layouts. Looks good on mobile, tablets, and desktop devices.
* Author sidebar with optional links to social media profiles.
* Disqus comments.
* Google analytics

> An important thing for me is that githubpages is for free, also if you use our own domain because I'm not posting everyday and I don't plan to monetize the site,
 I just want a cool landing page and blog.
