I have a Macbook Air and a desktop PC. As a .NET developer I expend more "productive" time on the PC, even if I have a windows partition installed on the Macbook. I started using Jekyll on the MacOS since it was the easy, standard way, but I like flexibility and started looking for how to use it from Windows, I wanted to create new posts from my PC basically.

Following the steps on 
[Run Jekyll on Windows](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) I didn't find any issues. 
The steps are:

1. Install Ruby
2. Instal Ruby DevKit
3. Install Jekyll gem

If you are using the same theme as me (Minimal Mistakes), there are [some specific commands](https://mademistakes.com/articles/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/#installation)

>Don't forget to install [Python 2.7.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-278/) if you still donÂ¡t have it and remember to add "python" to the system path , the installer can make it for you.

Enjoy windows lovers!
