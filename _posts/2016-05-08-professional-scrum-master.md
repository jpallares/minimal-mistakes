I recently obtained the Professional Scrum Master certification (PSM I) issued by [scrum.org](scrum.org). In order to do it I had avantage since I received official training but anyway I think is doable without it, some tips:

* **There’s no Sprint 0**. Also no hardening Sprint, integration Sprint, release Sprint, planning Sprint, etc. All Sprints are the same.
* Only the **Development Team** are **required** to participate in the **Daily Scrums**.
* There’s always only **one Product Backlog** and **one Product Owner**, no matter how many teams are working on the project.
* There are no roles other than those three standard ones, and **none of them manage the rest**, development teams self organize.

With this input a lot of questions that may appear in the test can be answered much more easily. Apart for the tips, the preparation shoul be:

* Read the [scrum guide](http://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)
* Read books such as - Scrum and Xp From the trenches, Kanban & Scrum
* Work with SCRUM framework in your current employment (if possible)
* Do Scrum Open assessment several times and takes notes of the erros, don't stop until you get 100% always
* Read the [agile manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

During the exam, use the bookmarks to mark the questions you have some doubts and go through them in a second iteration (hahaha the scrum way!)

Good luck!
