I just finished reading [C# in depth by Jon Skeet](http://www.amazon.com/Depth-3rd-Edition-Jon-Skeet/dp/161729134X), the book covers the evolution from the first version of C# until C# 5 (at least the edition I read). Explaining in detail all the new features that have been added during time.

The book is divided in 5 parts:

1. **C# 1 core foundations** This is an introduction to the book - experienced developers could skip it completely if they really wanted to

2. **C# 2 new features**
	* Generics
	* Nullable types
	* Anonymous methods in delegates
	* Yield statement
	* Minor features like partial types, stacic classes, separate getter/setter property access, namespace aliases, exposiing internals to selected assemblies...  

3. **C# 3 LINQ**
	* Features contributing LINQ (automatically implemented properties, implicit typing of local variables, simplified initialization, implicity typed arrays and anonymous types)
	* Lambda expressions and expression trees
	* Extension methodds
	* Query expressions and LINQ to objects
	* LINQ beyond collections  

4. **C# 4 Dynamic typing** and minor changes
	* Optional parameters, generic variance...
	* Dynamic binding in static language  

5. **C# 5 Asynchrony with async/await**

{: .notice}  
I recommend this book to all the C# experienced developers who want to improve his knowledge about they language they use daily.
